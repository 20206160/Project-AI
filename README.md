# checkers using AI

This project implements a Checkers (Draughts) game where two AI agents play against each other. The game is powered by the MinMax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize decision-making by evaluating possible moves and reducing the number of nodes to explore in the decision tree. There is no human involvement; the two AI agents take turns making moves, aiming to play the game optimally.

The project is written in Python and provides an AI-driven checkers game simulation where the two agents utilize MinMax and Alpha-Beta Pruning techniques to decide on their moves.
